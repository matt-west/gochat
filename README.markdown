# Real-Time Messaging using WebSockets, GO and jQuery #

Currently supports multi-user threads and real-time updates (as typed).

There are still a few bugs that can cause the program to error, however the application should recover and continue to run.

Thanks to Gary Burd for writting the original GO server code which this is based upon.

## Installation

Compile, Link and Run

1. 8g chat.go
2. 8l chat.8
